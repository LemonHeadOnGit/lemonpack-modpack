This repository stores the JAR files, config files, and any other necessary files that makes the modpack what it is.

### THE REPOSITORY IS STILL IN EARLY STAGES, SO NOT EVERYTHING IS HERE YET.

## ` YOU ARE CURRENTLY ON THE CLIENT VERSION OF THE MODPACK `

---

The client version of the modpack includes various performance-enhancement mods. Two notable ones being VanillaFix and FoamFix.

VanillaFix has a major feature, being that it can prevent the whole Minecraft client from crashing.
