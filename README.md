This repository stores the JAR files, config files, and any other necessary files that makes the modpack what it is.

### THE REPOSITORY IS STILL IN EARLY STAGES, SO NOT EVERYTHING IS HERE YET.

### ` YOU ARE CURRENTLY ON THE CLIENT VERSION OF THE MODPACK `

---

The client version of the modpack includes various performance-enhancement mods. Two notable ones being VanillaFix and FoamFix.

VanillaFix has a major feature, being that it can prevent the whole Minecraft client from crashing.

If you want an explanation of what all the mods are, you can read the `MODS.md` file. Credits to the mod authors are also contained in that file.

Special thanks to these mod authors, mainly because I really enjoy their mods:

### INSTALLATION INSTRUCTIONS (SUBJECT TO CHANGE)

Step 0. Download the 'main' branch of the repository, and download the [CurseForge Launcher](https://curseforge.overwolf.com) (no longer the Twitch Desktop app).

Step 1. Install the CurseForge Launcher. Navigate to the "Choose a Game" menu, and click on Minecraft. Follow the necessary instructions to get the Minecraft Instance running.

>Note: If there are problems installing the Minecraft Instance, run CurseForge as Administrator. You should **NOT** need to run it as Administrator again afterwards.

Step 2. Click on "Create Profile" and choose Minecraft Version 1.12.2. As of writing this, the latest forge version should be the one that comes up when selecting Minecraft 1.12.2. When ready, click the "Create" button.

Step 3. Click on the profile name, and click on the 3 to the left of the [Play] button. Click on profile options, and unselect use system memory. Drag the slider to anything above 5000MB.

>Important: If Minecraft crashes when loading mods, chances are, you need to allocate more RAM. There are times though when it crashes for no reason, so to make sure, click on Play again when launching the modpack.

Step 4. While still in the 3 Dots menu, click on Open Profile Folder. Drag and drop the dowmloaded repository files/folders into the profile folder. The three folders should be `mods`, `config` and `resources`.

Step 5. Go back to the CurseForge Launcher, and click play. When the Minecraft Launcher appears, log in and click [Play].

>It is recommended that you close any other unneeded applications to maximize on available CPU and RAM resources.
