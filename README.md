This repository stores the JAR files, config files, and any other necessary files that makes the modpack what it is.

### THE REPOSITORY IS STILL IN EARLY STAGES, SO NOT EVERYTHING IS HERE YET.

### ` YOU ARE CURRENTLY ON THE CLIENT VERSION OF THE MODPACK `

---

The client version of the modpack includes various performance-enhancement mods. Two notable ones being VanillaFix and FoamFix.

VanillaFix has a major feature, being that it can prevent the whole Minecraft client from crashing.

If you want an explanation of what all the mods are, you can read the `MODS.md` file. Credits to the mod authors are also contained in that file.

Special thanks to these mod authors, mainly because I really enjoy their mods:

### INSTALLATION INSTRUCTIONS (SUBJECT TO CHANGE)

Step 0. Click on the latest release of the modpack on the right side of this page (Usually CurseForge Release vX.X.X), and follow the instructions in the description of the release. Download the [CurseForge Launcher](https://curseforge.overwolf.com) (no longer the Twitch Desktop app).

Step 1. Install the CurseForge Launcher. Navigate to the "Choose a Game" menu, and click on Minecraft. Follow the necessary instructions to get the Minecraft Instance running.

>Note: If there are problems installing the Minecraft Instance, run CurseForge as Administrator. You should **NOT** need to run it as Administrator again afterwards.

Step 2. Click on [Create Custom Profile] and click on [import previously created profile].

Step 3. Wait for all the mods to download, and then click [Play]

>Important: If Minecraft crashes when loading mods, chances are, you need to allocate more RAM. There are times though when it crashes for no reason, so to make sure, click on Play again when launching the modpack. It is recommended that you close any other unneeded applications to maximize on available CPU and RAM resources.

### HELP AND INFORMATION
